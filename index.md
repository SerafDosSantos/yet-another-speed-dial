## FAQ

### How do I make changes to a Speed Dial?
Right-click the dial and select Edit to change the image, title, or URL.

### How do I backup and restore my data?
Speed dials are stored in the browser as bookmarks, so first, use the bookmark manager or browser sync to back them up. Then, to backup or restore your YASD settings and thumbnails, use the "Import and Export" feature in the YASD settings menu.

### One of my thumbnails is blank?
You can try fetching new images: right-click the dial and select "Refresh thumbnails".

### Can I fetch new images for all my speed dials at once?
For now this setting is hidden behind a special command: from the Speed Dial tab, press Ctrl+Shift+i to open the command prompt, then enter `refreshAllThumbnails()` and press enter. *Caution*: this will replace any existing images and may take a few minutes to complete.

### Can I open speed dial links in Firefox Containers?
Yes, just use Shift + Right-click on the speed dial to access the default context menu.

### Can I move multiple dials or folders at once?
Yes, since dials are just bookmarks you can arrange them in the bookmarks manager. Look for the *Other Bookmarks > Speed Dial* folder.

### I want new sites to appear at the bottom of the page and not the top
You can change this preference in *Settings > Sort*
