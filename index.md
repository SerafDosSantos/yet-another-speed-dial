## FAQs

### Can I use different images for the speed dials?
Yes! Just right-click the speed dial and select Edit.

### One of my site thumbnails disappeared?
YASD loads thumbnails using the Open Graph standard. This keeps those thumbnails up to date automatically, but if a website removes the image it may no longer load in YASD. To fetch new images, simply right-click the dial and select "Refresh thumbnails".

### How do I backup and restore my data?
Speed dials are stored in the browser as bookmarks, so first, use the bookmark manager or browser sync to back them up. Then, to backup or restore your YASD settings and thumbnails, use the "Import and Export" feature in the YASD settings menu.

### Can I open speed dial links in Firefox Containers?
Yes, just use Shift + Right-click on the speed dial to access the default context menu.

### Can I open speed dial links in new tabs?
Yes, just use Ctrl + Click or middle click.

### Can I sort folders?
Yes, arrange them directly inside the browser bookmarks manager. Drag and drop for folders is coming soon.
