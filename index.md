## FAQs

### How do I make changes to a Speed Dial?
Right-click the dial and select Edit to change the image, title, or URL.

### How do I backup and restore my data?
Speed dials are stored in the browser as bookmarks, so first, use the bookmark manager or browser sync to back them up. Then, to backup or restore your YASD settings and thumbnails, use the "Import and Export" feature in the YASD settings menu.

### How do I fetch new images for all my speed dials at once?
For now this setting is hidden behind a special command. From the Speed Dial tab, press Ctrl+Shift+i to open the command prompt, then enter `refreshAllThumbnails()` and press enter. *Caution*: this will replace any existing images and may take a few minutes to complete.

### One of my site thumbnails disappeared?
YASD loads thumbnails using the Open Graph standard. This keeps those thumbnails up to date automatically, but if a website removes the image it may no longer load in YASD. To fetch new images, simply right-click the dial and select "Refresh thumbnails".

### Can I open speed dial links in Firefox Containers?
Yes, just use Shift + Right-click on the speed dial to access the default context menu.

### Can I open speed dial links in new tabs?
Yes, just use Ctrl + Click or middle click.
